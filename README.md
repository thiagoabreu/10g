A lightweight version of Telegram, aimed to run on small devices with limited
hardware like the one with KaiOS.

## (Should be) Using:

- [ ] [TDLib](https://github.com/tdlib/td) via
      [Airgram](https://github.com/airgram/airgram)

## Ok, but Why!?

There are two main motivations for me to be making this: First, I have a Nokia
8110 phone and there's no official Telegram app for it; Second, I came out in my
dayjob with this code structure (lib+modules+pages), and I want to try if it works
in other project beside the one it was created for.

## When can I use in my phone?

Well... I don't know if I will (of even if I can) put it on any store. But feel free to
download it and sideload it to your phone. Just wait for when it's ready.
